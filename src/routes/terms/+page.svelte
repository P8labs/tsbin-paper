      <h3>Publishing to IPFS</h3>
      <p>
        When you publish a paper, we send the rendered document to IPFS via
        Pinata.
      </p>
      <p>
        IPFS is a public, decentralized network. Published content becomes
        public and immutable. We cannot delete or modify it after publishing.
      </p>
      <p>Do not publish anything you do not want to be public.</p>

      <h3>Analytics</h3>
      <p>We use analytics only to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Count page visits</li>
        <li>Monitor basic performance</li>
        <li>Keep the service healthy</li>
      </ul>
      <p>We do not track:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>What you type</li>
        <li>What you export</li>
        <li>What you publish</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>IPFS Publishing</h2>
      <p>
        When you choose to publish content, it is uploaded to IPFS
        (InterPlanetary File System) via Pinata.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Important:</strong> IPFS is a public, decentralized network. Once
        you publish content to IPFS:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Your content becomes publicly accessible to anyone with the link
        </li>
        <li>Content is immutable and cannot be edited or deleted</li>
        <li>
          We do not control the IPFS network and cannot remove published content
        </li>
        <li>Content may be replicated across multiple nodes globally</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <strong
          >Do not publish anything you do not want to be permanently public.</strong
        >

      <h2>What is tsbin paper?</h2>
      <p>
        tsbin paper is a tiny tool that turns Markdown into something you can
        share. You paste. We render. You export.
      </p>
      <p>
        This project is part of the tsbin.tech tool collection, a set of small,
        sharp utilities built under P8labs.

      <h2>How it works</h2>
      <p>
        Paper takes your Markdown text and transforms it into a beautifully
        formatted document. You can then:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Export it as a high-quality image (PNG, SVG)</li>
        <li>
          Publish it permanently to IPFS for immutable, decentralized storage
        </li>
        <li>Share it with a simple link</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Privacy & Transparency</h2>
      <p>
        tsbin paper is open-source and completely transparent. We do not store
        your files on our backend in guest mode. Everything you write stays in
        your browser until you explicitly choose to publish.
      </p>
      <p>
        When you choose to publish content, it is uploaded to IPFS. IPFS is a
        public, decentralized network. Once published, your content becomes
        public and immutable. We do not control that network.
      </p>
      <p>
        We collect minimal analytics data to understand basic traffic patterns
        and keep the service healthy. We do not track what you write, paste, or
        export.
